                <h4>Commodities represent raw physical assets, such as gold, silver, oil, wheat, sugar etc.. With us, you won't have to take ownership of the underlying asset or worry about physical delivery. Generally they can be divided in 3 Groups: Energies, Metals and Agriculturals.</h4>

                        <p>We offer our clients trading on spot energy, such as Brent, WTI and Natural Gas, which are considered to be the most important raw material resources on the planet.</p>
                            <p>CFDs on energy are a popular choice for short-term trading, especially when there is a surge in energy consumption, as during periods of active growth, demand increases. Prices are determined by global supply and demand for the physical product.</p>
                            <p1><img src ="Images/oil-pumpjack-extraction-svgrepo-com.svg" style="width: 50px;margin-left:5px;margin-right: 10px; vertical-align: middle;"> Crude Oil</p1>
                                  <p>Often referred to as “black gold”, Oil is usually denominated in U.S. Dollars (hence the term 'Petrodollar'), so a weak dollar will commonly cause Oil prices to rise, as the price of the product is directly influenced by the value of the currency.</p>
                                <p>Oil-producing nations have a dramatic effect on the supply, and therefore the price, as they may withdraw or boost the physical quantity of barrels available in the market.</p>
                                <p>For example, since the mid-90s, the US imposed sanctions on Iran have prevented Iranian oil from entering the marketplace, widening the gap between supply and demand which results in higher prices. Another noteworthy event occurred in 2014 when a much lower demand from the EU and China caused a sharp decrease due to the excess supply. For many years, the US government has been building up its oil reserves and should these be released to the market, or used domestically, energy prices may drop sharply as a result.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="small-box">
                        <p1><img src ="Images/gas-pipe-svgrepo-com.svg" style="width: 50px;margin-left:5px;margin-right: 10px; vertical-align: middle;"> Natural Gas</p1>
                        <p>In the case of NatGas, an alternative energy commodity to oil, historical analysis shows a general correlation between the two, considering that natural gas is often released during the oil drilling process, and they are commonly produced by the same companies or nations.</p>
                          <p>In conclusion, a multitude of economic factors can affect the price of energy, including inflation rates, political or military tensions in producing nations, natural disasters, production costs and of course, OPEC decisions.</p>   
                          <p>Trading CFDs on energy allows you to speculate on price movement, without having to physically acquire the underlying asset. As prices fluctuate, traders make profit or loss depending on their position and direction in the market.</p>

                        <p>Trading spot metals allows investors to expand their portfolio by taking long or short positions on spot gold and silver. We ensure that your orders are executed at the most accurate and competitive prices. Spot gold is more valuable than spot silver, but they both share strong price movements.</p>
                            <p>Trading spot metals is often considered as a safe, haven investment, especially at times of economic uncertainty.</p>
                                  <p>Trading CFD does not only mean trading currencies, stocks and indices, but also means trading Precious Metals. The most popular Metals on the market are gold and silver.</p>
                                  <p1><img src ="Images/gold-ingots-gold-svgrepo-com.svg" style="width: 50px;margin-left:5px;margin-right: 10px; vertical-align: middle;">  Gold</p1>
                                <p>Gold is the most liquid asset, as it's very susceptible to economic and financial changes (the increasing/decreasing of the US interest rates, in particular). It has a high correlation with the leading world currencies: the Euro and the Dollar.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes this correlation with major currencies is negative (e.g. the euro is in an upward trend while gold is in a decline). However, it does happen from time to time, that the Australian dollar quotes have a positive correlation with the GOLD chart (both going upward, for example).</p>
                                <p>Metals trading is affected by seasons, market volume, and up/down trends throughout the day. As a general rule trading decisions should be made based on data from the Economic Calendar and it's best to follow statistics from America and China</p>
                                <p>At the end of 2016, the trading volume of gold exceeded 24.3 tons.</p>

                        <p>Global industry plays a large role in trading Precious metals: silver mining companies, and the main buyers of silver, create the market for it. Therefore, it's important to not only follow the general high-tech and metal-mining news, but also pay attention to regional events when predicting price movements.</p>
                          <p>Issues with Precious Metals production or new investment into the business are things that can cause corresponding market fluctuations. E.g., the price of Silver depends on the main factors of the global economy - inflation, GDP growth, refinancing rates and decisions made by the global central banks.</p>   
                          <p>During periods of economic upheaval, Precious Metals prices jump, as more and more investors seek to protect their capital from febrile changes in the foreign exchange market.</p>
                          <p>Moreover, experts say that Silver is not an unlimited resource which means that its price will constantly increase over time - so, the analysts predict a further upward trend.</p>
                          <p>As a rule of thumb, gold and silver, react negatively to the growth of stock indices, at which point the attractiveness of Precious Metals as a 'safe asset' decreases.</p>
                          <p1><img src="Images/palladium.svg"></p1>
                          <p>As far as Platinum trading goes, the main factor affecting its exchange value is the balance of supply and demand. Unlike gold, which is mined in its purest form, Platinum exists only in the form of an alloy with other metals, due to the process of extraction and separation being complicated and energy consuming.</p>
                          <p>Because of that the global annual production of Platinum is only approximately 5 million troy ounces, which is not large figure in comparison to the annual gold production, which is 17 times higher, and silver which is 100 times higher.</p>
                          <p>Platinum has specific properties that keep this metal in demand in many industries, although, approximately 40% of it is used in automobile production.</p>

                          <p>The biggest international locations for trading Precious Metals are London, New York and Shanghai. Other locations share a smaller volume of the Precious Metals trade.</p>   
                          <img src="Images/london.svg"  style="float: left; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom:10px;"><p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) specializes in intermediary transactions with non-ferrous Metals. Its history is associated with raw materials coming to the UK from overseas for production of tin and copper. The exchange started in 1877 with copper trading. Short-term contracts were signed for three months, which was the time it took for the Metals to travel from Singapore and South America to the United Kingdom.</p>
                          <img src="Images/ny.svg" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;padding-bottom:10px;"><p>The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is a futures market. One of its divisions is the COMEX which is engaged in trading operations of buying and selling options and futures of non-ferrous and Precious Metals: gold, silver, aluminium, copper and others. Approximately 15 thousand exchange transactions with Metals are executed at NYMEX annually.</p>
                          <img src="Images/shangai.svg" style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;padding-bottom:10px;"><p>The Shanghai Gold Exchange is the largest and one of the leading platforms of Precious Metals trading in the world. Founded in 2002 it has the status of a non-profit organization, and both Chinese companies as well as foreign banks have the right to participate. Precious Metals trading is carried out mainly with options and futures on gold bullions.</p>

                          <p>The agricultural, or soft commodities sector, is composed of grains and oilseeds; livestock, primarily cattle and hogs; sugar; cocoa; coffee; cotton; and orange juice. Ethanol for fuel, but produced from corn, sugar cane, or other crop has become an increasingly important agricultural product.   Grains and oilseeds include wheat, corn, soybeans and also barley, sorghum grain, oats, flaxseed and rye.</p>   
                          <p>Due to their versatility and demand on the market, cereal grains tend to keep a fair price. The value of cereal grains is determined by accessing the spread of the price between the grains. </p>
